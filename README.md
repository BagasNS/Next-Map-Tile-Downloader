# Next Map Tiles Downloader (Work in Progress)

**Note:** This project is currently a work in progress, and not all features are fully implemented. Please read below
for information about the project's status.

## Overview

This project was inspired by [Map Tiles Downloader](https://github.com/AliFlux/MapTilesDownloader) created by [
Ali Ashraf](https://github.com/AliFlux), a fantastic tool for downloading map tiles. My goal is to build upon its
foundation and provide an enhanced and more stable version with additional features.

### Key Points:

1. **Building on Inspiration**: I acknowledge the pioneering work
   of [Map Tiles Downloader](https://github.com/AliFlux/MapTilesDownloader) created by [
   Ali Ashraf](https://github.com/AliFlux) and aim to carry forward its legacy.

2. **Feature Parity**: My objective is to offer all the features available in the original app. You can expect the same
   familiar functionalities plus more.

3. **Stability Improvements**: I'm addressing issues such as crashing browser tabs when downloading large areas and high
   zoom levels. My aim is to provide a stable and reliable user experience.

4. **GeoJSON Support**: One of the exciting new features is the ability to download map tiles based on GeoJSON files.
   You can specify polygon and/or multi-polygon geometries, making it even more versatile for your mapping needs.

I am committed to creating a robust and user-friendly tool for accessing and downloading map tiles. Stay tuned for
updates and enhancements as I work towards achieving these goals.
